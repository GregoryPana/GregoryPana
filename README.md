My name is Gregory Panagary, I am currently 23 years old and a student at Asia Pacific University (APU) Malaysia. I am undertaking a course in Computer Engineering hoping to finish with a Bachelor's Degree.
I started my course in 2021 and i am expected to fnish in 2025. I am an enthusiastic programmer that loves a good challenge to get me thinking and requires me to improve on my skills to complete.
I completed my A Level studies in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry so i am a capable student. In my time in A levels Computer SCience i began programming with the language Visial Basic and learned the fundamentals. After completing my A levels and starting my Degree in Computer Engineering I have also learned introductions to Python and C so i am familiar with these programming languages. During my gap year between the end of 2019 and mid 2021 I entered the world of work where i worked as a teacher for IT in a secondary School for many months and later as a programmer in a Tech company in my home country Seychelles.
At the Technology company Space95 I familiarized myswelf with front and beckend programming of a database and its web portal. I was part of a team that designed an application during the covid times to scan a qr cde to help the contact tracing team of the government identify potential infected people and contact them. I learned the ins and outs of an SQL Database and worked with PHP for the web side.
