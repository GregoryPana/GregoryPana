Iâ€™m Gregory Panagary, a 24yo Computer Engineering graduate from Asia Pacific University (Malaysia), now back in Seychelles and eager to contribute to the local tech landscape. My work blends full-stack development, machine learning, and computer vision to build smart, practical systems that solve real-world problems.

Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve designed and implemented a range of projects â€” from AI-powered surveillance and smart agriculture systems to business intelligence dashboards and defect detection using deep learning. These experiences strengthened my skills across both software and hardware, from developing user-friendly web apps to training neural networks and deploying embedded solutions.

Iâ€™m especially passionate about using technology in ethical, sustainable ways to automate tasks, enhance decision-making, and improve user experiences. Whether itâ€™s backend logic, UI design, or intelligent automation, Iâ€™m always curious to learn and innovate.

Now back home, Iâ€™m actively exploring opportunities in Seychelles to apply what Iâ€™ve learned â€” whether in software engineering, AI, or data-driven solutions that support local industries like finance, health, agriculture, or tourism. I value collaboration, continuous learning, and making an impact with technology.

Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re looking for someone who brings a mix of technical depth, creative thinking, and multicultural perspective to your team.
