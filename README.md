I’m Gregory Panagary, a 24yo Computer Engineering Masters Graduate from Asia Pacific University (Malaysia), now back in Seychelles and eager to contribute to the local tech landscape. My work blends full-stack development, machine learning, and computer vision to build smart, practical systems that solve real-world problems.

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve designed and implemented a range of projects — from AI-powered surveillance and smart agriculture systems to business intelligence dashboards and defect detection using deep learning. These experiences strengthened my skills across both software and hardware, from developing user-friendly web apps to training neural networks and deploying embedded solutions.

I’m especially passionate about using technology in ethical, sustainable ways to automate tasks, enhance decision-making, and improve user experiences. Whether it’s backend logic, UI design, or intelligent automation, I’m always curious to learn and innovate.


I am a driven and adaptable technology professional currently working at Cable & Wireless Seychelles, where I contribute to advancing digital solutions that improve efficiency, connectivity, and customer experience. With a background in Computer Engineering and hands-on experience in AI systems, automation, and IT infrastructure, I bring a strong blend of technical expertise and problem-solving skills to my work.

I’m passionate about leveraging emerging technologies to create practical, scalable solutions that deliver real value—whether through optimizing operations, enhancing data-driven decision-making, or streamlining complex workflows. My career path is fueled by curiosity, continuous learning, and a commitment to delivering results that make a tangible impact.

Beyond my technical work, I value collaboration, adaptability, and clear communication, believing they are essential to driving innovation in fast-changing industries. I am always open to connecting with like-minded professionals, sharing insights, and exploring opportunities for growth and collaboration.
